    <strong>What are the goals of Game Development Club?</strong>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
            We aim to give any student that is eager to learn about Game Development
            the oppurtunity to work on a student-created project, that will lead to the
            growth of development skills and/or creation of assets in the field of Game Development.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            Create a community of students interested in contributing to games. Anyone 
            with a passion for video games and their creation are welcome!
        </li>

    <strong>What can I do in Game Development Club?</strong>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
            This is entirely up to you. We have many aspects of Game Development that require
            some portion of attention, including Sound, Music, Design, Development, Art, etc.
            That being the case, we can use as many helping hands as possible!
